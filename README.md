# gtd
This is a very early revision of a productivity program based on the ideas in Getting Things Done by David Allen. I'm not entirely sure how serious I intend to take this project just yet. I just wanted a way to keep track of things I have to do in a form that I'm able to customize (and learn a little flutter in the process). Currently, the repository is in a rough draft-like state. I rushed putting it together because I wanted to start using it, so the code is pretty rough at the moment.

# Features
- [X] Inbox to record obligations as they appear
- [X] Tab to create projects and tasks for the projects
- [ ] A list of next actions for each project
- [ ] A calendar where tasks can be scheduled
- [ ] Sync to cloud (don't hold your breath for this)

# Contributions
Feel free to contribute to the project. I'm very new to dart/flutter, and, accordingly, the code is a complete mess. Any suggestions for how to improve the codebase are very appreciated.
